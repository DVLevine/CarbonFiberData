These are instron files from 4/13/2023 collected on an instron machine in Makerworks. 

The machine settings for each test:

  Keel:
      increase deflection and therefore load until either 1cm deflection or 1000N
      
  J-Spring:
      increase deflection and therefore load until either 4cm deflection or 1400N
